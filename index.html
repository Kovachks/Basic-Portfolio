	<p>My name is Keith Kovach.  I was born in Cleveland, OH and lived there for the first 18 years of my life.  I went to college at the University of Cincinnati and majored in Accounting.  Once I graduated in 2013 I decided to follow my girlfriend to the carolinas and moved to Charlotte, NC.  I have lived here ever since and love it down here.</p>
	<p>My hobbies include video games, which I mostly play World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Squad and a few select others depending on how I'm feeling.  I love sports and am an avid basketball player along with following my favorite teams which include the Cleveland Cavaliers, Cleveland Indians and all Cincinnati Bearcats athletic teams</p>
